abstract: "We measure the temporal evolution of three-dimensional membrane topography on living fibroblasts and characterize the propagation of membrane waves using a wide-field optical profiling technique. The measured membrane profiles are compared with the numerical results calculated by the active membrane model recently proposed by Shlomovitz and Gov. After the treatments of blebbistatin and latrunculin A separately, the membrane waves disappear and the membrane surfaces are flattened, verifying that the membrane waves are driven by the interactions between myosin II and actin polymerization."

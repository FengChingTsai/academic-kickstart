Welcome to my website. I am Feng, an independent project leader in the department of [Physics of Cells and 
Cancer](https://institut-curie.org/unit/umr168/) at Institut Curie in Paris.

**Our research focus - self-assembly of active protein complexes on membranes** \
Over the last 5 years, we have focused on understanding how the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane curvature-senesing proteins drive membrane remodeling processes such as filopodia formation, endocytosis and macropinocytosis in cells.

**Our research tools** \
We have developed a multidisciplinary approach combining synthetic systems and quantitative physical measurements, including the use of optical tweezers. 

**Our research team** \
Since 2019, the members of my team are Cecile Maguin (Master student, background in physics, 2020), [Gwendal Guerin](https://curie.fr/personne/gwendal-guerin) (PhD student, background in biochemistry, November 2021-present) and [Simli Dey](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=-wFQ7RsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) (postdoc with expertise in optics and biophysics, September 2021-present).

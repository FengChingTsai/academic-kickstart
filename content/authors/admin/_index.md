Welcome to my website. I am Feng. I am a project leader in [Membrane and Cellular Function group](https://science.curie.fr/recherche/physique-chimie-biologie-multi-echelle-et-cancer/physico-chimie/equipe-bassereau/) in [Institut Curie](https://science.institut-curie.org/) in Paris.

**My research aim** \
Seek answers to fundamental questions about actin-driven membrane reshaping in membrane trafficking and the formation of cellular protrusions

**My research tools** \
Principles and tools of physics, and bottom-up approaches – *in vitro* reconstitution systems composed of model membranes and purified proteins

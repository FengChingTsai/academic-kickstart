Filopodia are finger-like membrane protrusions involved in many cellular processes including cell migration, adhesion, cell-cell communication, and embryogenesis. 
Filopodia are characterized by their highly curved membranes and the enveloped actin filaments that are bundled parallelly by fascin. 
So far, the precise mechanism of filopodia formation remain debatable.
We aim to provide a comprehensive knowledge of how filopodia are generated by performing experiments using *in cellulo* systems, and *in vitro* reconstitution systems composed of purified proteins and model membranes.
